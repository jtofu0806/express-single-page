# Express-Single-Page

At first, this project is generated by using [express-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator) with no view engine option.
(But excluded the ```/public``` folder manually, should add a new one.)
```
express --no-view my-project
```

Then, configure routing to be handled by the front-end framework, like Angular.

## Usage

### Start express (PORT=8080)
```
npm start
```

### PORT

By default, load environment variables from ```.env``` file.

Also, can set on the command line,
```
PORT=8080 node ./bin/www
```

**windows cmd**
```cmd
set PORT=8080 && node ./bin/www
```

As setting```NODE_ENV=production```, use PORT defined in the system (default is 3000).
```
NODE_ENV=production node ./bin/www
```

**windows cmd**
```cmd
set NODE_ENV=production && node ./bin/www
```

## Configuration

### Routing

Currently, static resources would be placed into ```/public``` folder under the root, and the start page is ```/public/index.html```.
```javascript
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + '/public/index.html');
});
```
